# Plotly-Dash-Traefik-Quant-Project-Example

Welcome to the Plotly-Dash-Traefik-Example repository! This project showcases a minimal yet powerful setup for deploying a [Plotly Dash][1] application using Traefik and Docker.

## Overview

Plotly Dash is a highly productive Python framework designed for building web-based analytical applications. By combining the simplicity of Python with the power of JavaScript, Dash makes it easy to create interactive, visually appealing dashboards.

This repository includes a single-page application built with Python 3.9, encapsulated within Docker containers, and managed through Traefik. This architecture ensures your dashboards are scalable and easy to deploy.

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

If you need installation instructions for these tools, numerous comprehensive guides are available online.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the example application:

1. **Create the Docker Network**

   First, create a network named `dash-net` if it doesn't already exist:

   ```sh
   # Create the network app-net if it does not exist
   $ docker network inspect dash-net >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
       docker network create -d overlay dash-net
   ```

2. **Deploy the Stack**

   Use Docker Compose to deploy the application stack:

   ```sh
   # Deploy the stack
   $ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml dash
   ```

3. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `localhost` (port 8000)
